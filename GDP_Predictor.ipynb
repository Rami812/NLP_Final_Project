Eduardo Malinis, Insurance Commissioner and Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Insurance Congress of Developing Countries 2009, other distinguished speakers, distinguished delegates to this Insurance Congress, ladies and gentlemen, good morning. To our visiting delegates, Welcome to Manila! Welcome to the Philippines! I hope youve had or you will have the chance to partake of the many options to help further stimulate our domestic economy. I am sure all of us in this room have heard about the different financial stability and fiscal stimulus packages, being pursued by economies across the globe, to help stem the impact of the current global financial and economic crisis. I am certain the organizers of ICDC Manila 2009 have also put together their own version of a post-meeting stimulus package to complement the many interesting conference breakout sessions. For my part, Id like to encourage all of you to participate as actively in that endeavor as you would in the different sessions in the next three days. Let me begin my remarks this morning by thanking Commissioner Ed Malinis and the Congress organizers for inviting me to speak before you today. At first blush, the keynote message for a gathering of insurers to be delivered by the governor of a central bank that supervises only the banking sector, may be a bit peculiar. But if one seriously looks at the situation, it is indeed quite reflective of the theme of the Congress, which is Financial Stability through Collaboration and Understanding. Ladies and gentlemen, at no other time than now has the need for promoting financial stability been more imperative. As we are all keenly aware, the current financial turmoil has gone beyond the borders of the epicenter of the financial crisis  the US and the major economies  and has reached the shores of emerging markets. More importantly, the global financial turmoil has transcended the bounds of the financial realm and has crossed over to the real sector of most economies, including several represented here today. You will be pleased to know that my remarks this morning will be brief. I only have two messages that I wish to bring across, in light of our desire for financial stability. First is that, information efficiency must be created and maintained among financial regulators. As we have witnessed in this current crisis, the lines delineating the financial institutions that make up the financial system have become at times blurred, making improved collaboration among financial regulators exigent. Second, there must be a conscious effort among regulators to devote more resources to the regulation of the conduct of business. There is often the temptation during a large-scale (global) crisis, such the one we are in at the moment, to speak only about systemically important institutions. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we must be careful not to forget the public that ultimately we serve. We must remember that the financial sophistication of the investing public may not necessarily coincide with the pace of financial innovation. This creates a gap that could result in the public not fully appreciating the products and new structures that they are investing in, thereby unduly exposing them to risk. I. The need for information efficiency In discussing my first point, which is the need for information efficiency, Id like to highlight two recent developments in the global financial markets. First, the convergence among 38/2009 1 different types of financial institutions. And second, the convergence in the framework for financial regulation and supervision. A. Convergence among different types of financial institutions The financial crisis in the US, as we now understand it, is partly explained by the relatively loose regulation of entities heavily involved in financial innovation, including the oversight of the sale of these products to the wider public. Financial markets have developed in recent years so that the same financial products are sold across different financial sub-sectors  from banks to insurance companies, to securities firms, with several cross-combinations thereof. In addition, the emergence (through common ownership) of financial conglomerates that encompass the different types of financial institutions has eroded the long-standing barriers that kept these business lines apart. With these changes, it has become important that financial regulators clearly understand the mechanisms for passing on of risks among these different sub-sectors. Let me illustrate. The distress certain insurance companies currently face can be directly traced to their exposure to risks that originated in the banking system, including structured products and derivatives whose underlying assets were sub-prime mortgages. This further highlights the fact that the risks to financial soundness of insurance firms may now also arise from the asset side of their balance sheets, a clear departure from the traditional insurance firm risk management practice that focused exclusively on the underwriting risks associated with insurance liabilities. Indeed, the barriers that used to separate the analysis of risks in different lines of business have slowly been breaking down. To give you another example, unlike in their old (standard) business models, banks are now paying more attention to the adequacy of pricing risk exposures so as to at least cover expected losses. In many business models, this is called the probability function for loss given default. Curiously, this is central to and is a long-standing practice among insurance firms. As we are now able to appreciate, this product and financial structure convergence has been driven by financial liberalization and advances in information and financial technology. Developments in risk management and in valuation methodologies also helped to heighten convergence. These factors nurtured convergence, particularly during the extended lowinterest rate environment  referred to as The Great Moderation  when market participants sought to enhance yield and offload or spread risk. B. Convergence in the framework of prudential regulation and supervision A second major development in the financial market, which makes information efficiency among regulators urgent, is the convergence in the framework of prudential regulation and supervision. Just as in banking, for instance, a set of core principles now lays out the broad prudential framework in insurance too. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) has released just two weeks ago an Issues Paper on Group-Wide Solvency Assessment and Supervision. This sets out the future IAIS work on the development of a comprehensive suite of supervisory papers on group-wide solvency assessment and supervision. One could look at this as the international insurance industrys version of the capital adequacy framework under Basel II for banks. It is not only, however, the framework for prudential regulation and supervision that has converged. At the national level (counting over 30 countries now), there has also been a physical convergence of the different financial supervisory bodies  more specifically the establishment of integrated supervisors (i.e., supervisors that are responsible for at least two (2) types of financial institutions). 2 38/2009 Internationally though, the convergence has not really been physical but only intellectual, with the creation of the Joint Forum. The Joint Forum is composed of international financial supervisory organizations, namely, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and the IAIS. The Forum has been performing a valuable role in identifying differences in prudential arrangements across sectors and in considering the ever larger set of issues of common interest across the different supervisory communities. C. The Philippine case In the Philippines, we do not have an integrated supervisor for the financial system although, as I will explain later, there are existing collaborative arrangements among the different financial supervisory agencies in order to achieve our goal of a stable financial system. Supervision of the Philippine financial system follows a silo approach, i.e., each supervisory agency is responsible for supervision of a certain segment of the system  (1) the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) for banks and quasi-banks, their financial allied subsidiaries and affiliates; non stock savings and loan associations, and pawnshops; (2) the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for investment houses, financing companies, securities dealers/brokers, investment companies, and pre-need companies; and (3) the Insurance Commission (IC) for insurance and reinsurance companies, insurance brokers, and mutual benefit associations. While the BSP supervises the largest financial groups holding the bulk of the financial systems resources, in some instances, the existing mandates of the three supervisory agencies result in overlaps in supervisory jurisdictions. These overlaps are, however, remedied by our continuous collaborative efforts. Most notable of these collaborative efforts is the establishment in 2004 of the Financial Sector Forum (FSF), which is similar to the Joint Forum but only on a national scale. The FSF is comprised of the three supervisory agencies  the BSP, the SEC and the IC  together with the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC). The members of the FSF are the heads of the four member agencies, with the BSP Governor as the Chair. FSF is essentially a cooperative effort without any legal mandate lest it be construed as being an integrated supervisory body. A quick survey among the participants in this Congress will show that there is no clearly identifiable single optimal model for supervision. There are motivations commonly cited for establishing consolidated supervision, although no standard has been established for its design. These motivations include 1) regulatory consistency and coordination to harmonize rules and standards, 2) the difficulty that hybrid financial instruments and presence of financial conglomerates pose to separate regulators, and 3) the value of economies of scale given limited financial and human resources. What is evident in all discussions, however, is the need to share information efficiently, regardless of the form of supervision structure present in the economy. Ladies and gentlemen, what is incumbent among financial supervisors in order to facilitate and strengthen financial stability at this time, is to create and maintain an information sharing structure that will allow all to react swiftly and preemptively to changes in the operating environment. This will certainly help prevent the occurrence of a crisis of the magnitude and breadth were seeing today. II. Conduct of business supervision Let me now move on to my second message which, I believe is an issue that is of particular interest to developing countries. One characteristic of developing countries is the relatively weaker financial sophistication of their consumers, which makes the customers quite vulnerable to financial scams, including relatively simple ones. I believe therefore that financial supervision in developing countries 38/2009 3 should not only focus on setting prudential standards, but also on strengthening conduct of business oversight of financial institutions (i.e., supervision of the business practices, including dealings with customers). The increased globalization of the financial industry presents a further complication as globalization improves the availability of and access to complex financial products across developing countries, without necessarily discriminating among levels of sophistication of the target markets. Ensuring that financial institutions conduct their business in a proper and transparent manner should therefore be a primary concern for financial supervisors in developing countries. Failure to ensure proper business conduct by financial institutions would have adverse implications on market confidence, which, in turn, could threaten the viability of the financial markets as source of funds that could support the productive capacity of the economy. This point could not be more apparent in the developments in the global financial markets we are witnessing right now. The fallout from the global financial crisis left many investors in financial products with substantial losses, and exposed some investment schemes as economically unsound if not totally fraudulent. The immediate impact was the weakening of confidence in financial markets, which played a key role in stoking the crisis. Restoring market confidence through conduct of business supervision is therefore essential in order to restore the smooth functioning of financial markets. In the Philippines, financial supervisors, independently and in collaboration with the Financial Sector Forum, have already undertaken initiatives and issued rules to improve the conduct of business by financial institutions, especially those relating to complex products and services. The BSP, for instance, came out with circulars requiring banks and trust entities to take a more pro-active responsibility in marketing their derivative and trust products by conducting client suitability tests. Under these rules, the bank/trustee shall perform a client profiling process under the general principles on client suitability assessment to guide the client in choosing investment outlets that are best suited to his objectives, risk tolerance, preferences and experience. In addition, the BSP has tightened disclosure requirements covering the interest structure on credit cards, fees paid on loans and deposits, and the management and custody fees for trust funds. The FSF, for its part, has also intensified the release of advisories against fraudulent and unsound corporate financial practices. Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude my remarks this morning by recapping my two points. The increasing convergence of the different types of financial institutions and financial products calls for closer collaboration among the different financial supervisory agencies or units in order to ensure financial stability. For the developing countries, however, another important issue is the refocusing of financial supervision to include not only the oversight role of supervisors in the safety and soundness of financial institutions, but also the oversight role of supervisors in the conduct of business of these institutions. I trust that these would be food for thought among you, as you consider the many different issues that surround financial stability during these very difficult and challenging times. I wish you all a productive and meaningful Congress. Thank you very much for your attention, and good day. 4 38/2009\",\n          \"Philip R Lane: Dual perspectives on the insurance sector  consumer protection and financial stability Address by Mr Philip R Lane, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, at Insurance Europes 8th Annual Conference, Dublin, 25 May 2016. * * * Acknowledgements: I thank Allan Kearns for his input into this speech. Good morning. I am pleased to welcome you to Dublin for the 8th Insurance Europe conference. This event also marks the 30th anniversary of the Insurance Ireland industry association. The theme of todays conference is Serving Our Customer in Tomorrows World. As the regulator of the insurance sector, the Central Bank of Ireland is continuously engaged with the topics to be discussed in todays panel sessions. In addition, from a central banking perspective, the high degree of interconnectedness between the insurance sector and other parts of the European financial system means that we also monitor the insurance sector in relation to our financial stability mandate at both domestic and European levels. Let me share a few ideas in relation to the themes of the conference. The first panel addresses the impact of the regulatory environment on consumers. A wellfunctioning insurance sector is essential in managing the risks faced by households and firms. The importance of the insurance sector to European citizens has motivated the introduction of a modernised regulatory framework in the form of Solvency II, with the twin goals of enhancing consumer protection and maintaining financial stability. An important property of Solvency II is that it is a maximum harmonisation regime, and so should increase supervisory convergence across Europe. In view of the high degree of cross-border trade in insurance products, the Central Bank of Ireland strongly supports convergence in supervisory standards, which would contribute in a significant way to the long-term resilience of the financial system in Ireland and Europe. Most of the policyholders of Irish-resident insurance firms are abroad; in the other direction, many Irish policyholders are covered by foreign European firms. Regardless of location, all customers should benefit from the same high standards of supervision and should all rest assured that their underwriters are unlikely to fail. However, much work remains to be completed in attaining the goal of consistent supervisory standards across Europe. Furthermore, the coordination of national protection schemes for policyholders remains unsatisfactory: should an insurance firm fail, citizens are covered in full, in part or not at all, depending on where they are and where their insurers are regulated. Solvency II has also left untouched the processes, conditions and standards for authorisations. I can only encourage EIOPA to press on this issue and ensure that firms that would not be authorised in one country do not find a home in another. Two of the panel discussions today focus on the customer in tomorrows world. Let me comment on the role of technological innovation in distribution channels. First, more widespread deployment of online distribution channels has the potential to reduce costs, expand access to insurance products and improve consumer convenience. However, at the same time, online distribution requires a parallel increase in attention to cyber risk. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors has recently discussed this topic, highlighting that the foundation of the insurance business is trust, and that trust could be irrevocably shaken if sensitive data were lost or claims payments disrupted. Our assessment at the Central Bank of Ireland is that cyber risks pose not only financial and reputational risks for individual insurance firms but that there are wider consequences for prudential supervision, consumer protection and financial stability. BIS central bankers speeches 1 Second, the automation of advice to potential customers is a promising development. However, as recently highlighted by the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities, there are pros and cons to these tools from a consumer perspective. The potential benefits include lower costs, increased convenience and greater consistency in advice. The primary disadvantage is the risk of an unsuitable final recommendation due to the lack of a human advisor. To represent a net gain for consumers, the design of automated advice systems must ensure that consumers are provided with clear, accurate and relevant information and recommended suitable products appropriate to their needs. The properties of suitability and transparency are among the most important principles underpinning the Central Banks consumer protection framework and are increasingly important in this period of rapid technological innovation. One of the panel sessions will focus on global and European financial stability. In the international regulatory community, there is increasing interest in the inter-relations between the insurance sector and the stability of the broader financial system. In one direction, excessive risk taking by insurance firms can be a source of financial instability, both directly and indirectly through the interconnections between the insurance sector, other financial intermediaries and financial markets. In the other direction, the insurance sector can make a positive contribution to financial stability, given the potential complementarities between the balance sheet structure of the insurance sector and the balance sheet structures of other sectors. Much of the current risk discussion has focused on the implications of a protracted low interest rate environment for the insurance sector.1 The sector needs to reflect carefully on its strategic response to a prolonged low interest rate environment. For instance, for those firms within the life sector that have traditionally included guaranteed returns to policyholders, there is clearly a challenge to this business model. In terms of replacing that business or earning returns to support legacy guarantees, it may be tempting to seek returns from nontraditional and non-insurance activities. However, this strategy has clearly been a source of fragility for firms in the past. For non-life insurance, buoyant investment returns have subsidised the pricing of core insurance products. The response to a lower-yield environment should not be to chase returns by investing in ever riskier assets. Rather, the focus should be on earning an appropriate return from core underwriting activity. There is much in the new Solvency II framework that should allow firms to better manage risks associated with the low interest rate environment. In particular, the own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA) process should provide a framework for enhanced corporate understanding of interest rate and investment risks. For regulators, understanding how the insurance sector is likely to be affected by a prolonged low interest rate environment is also a priority. Indeed, the risk posed by the low interest rate environment is the core scenario that is contained within this years EIOPA stress test. Finally, I note that there is also a panel session on the global economic shift towards emerging economies. Judging by the disparity in insurance penetration rates, there appears to be significant medium-term growth opportunities in emerging economies. To the extent that the global growth in the insurance sector is partly served by an expansion in the international activities of European insurance firms, the scope for scale economies and diversification need to be balanced by appropriate management of some key risk factors. These include: the limits of managerial control over wide geographic spans; the complexities of local tax, social security and legal systems; and the correlations between underwriting returns in a given region and other exposures such as the performance of various asset 1 The implications of climate risk for the insurance sector is another prominent topic. I do not address this issue today. 2 BIS central bankers speeches classes and the sources of equity and debt funding. The insurance sector can learn much from the storied history of international banking in negotiating the opportunities and pitfalls associated with financial globalisation.

HOSKINS. #7. apARY Economic Prioritiesin 1989 and Beyond In thinking about next year's economy, I would like to focus on two issues: the economic outlook for 1989 and long-term objectives for monetary policy. As the events of the past year clearly demonstrate, life is full of Surprises. Not much more than a year ago 'we were sorting through the debris of the stock market decline, and attempting to gauge the impact of the shock on investors, businessmen and consumers. Generally, it seemed reasonable to expect at least a cooling in the economic expansion, and perhaps even more. Well, in retrospect, it didn't quite work that way, and we would be well advised to bear that in mind as we think about 1989. Clearly, a year ago, we underestimated the underlying strength and vigor of the expansion. Led by capital investment and export demands, and supported by solid increases jn consumption, the economy shook off the chilling effects of the stock market decline and moved ahead more rapidly than all but a few would have guessed. Today, as one evaluates the economy in the closing weeks of 1988, it is a pretty positive picture. There are few of the imbalances which normally precede a slowdown or recession. Inventories, for example, do not appear to be high. Capacity strains and favorable profit margins would suggest continued strength in business investment. Strong growth abroad seems likely to continue to support export demands. _ The conventional or consensus view of the coming year, after incorporating these factors, projects continued economic expansion, though at a more moderate pace than the past year, and in an environment of still moderate inflation. Those forecasters who see trouble on the horizon are betting that economic policy will have to forcefully deal with capacity strains and rising prices, with the result being recession. Well, as you would imagine, I do not plan to address that issue today. would simply note that many elements of the consensus view of next year appear pretty soundly based to me. The economy is closing this year on a very strong note. Those who expected a pause or a slowdown in the rapid pace of the expansion in the second half of the year, have instead seen continued strength in new orders, and rapid growth in employment and income. Our economy has moved closer to full capacity, although we should recognize that we really don't know precisely where that is. Foreign economies, both in Western Europe and Asta, have accelerated in the past year, again contrary to the forecasts of a year ago, and there is lVittle yet to suggest widespread or significant slowing. Inflation last year, while not as bad as the pessimists feared, was.a good deal worse than the optimists hoped. Regardless of which index one uses, the rate of inflation moved upward this past year, by one to one and a half percentage points into the 5 percent area. Not surprisingly, wages and costs have responded and are also rising along the same 5 percent track. So, for the first time since 198] the thrust of prices and wages is upward. One key overriding issue for 1989 is whether a slowing economy will hold inflation in the 5 percent area, or whether another step-up is already baked into the cake, so to speak, and how economic policymakers will react if inflation does indeed accelerate again. This leads me to the second issue which I believe we need to bear in mind. Simply put, how do the possible outcomes in the year ahead relate to monetary policy and to the effort to achieve longer-term objectives? What are these objectives or what should they be? Unfortunately, neither economists nor policymakers agree fully on objectives. In recent years, however, we have come closer to agreement. I will argue today that there should be one overriding objective for monetary policy _-the provision of a stable price environment. I will also offer some suggestions about how I think this objective can be achieved. The Objective: Price Stability Our monetary system is a complex network of rules, procedures and tnstitutions. Ideally, it promotes the efficient allocation of resources by reducing transaction and information costs. Any monetary system should promote an environment in which money provides a unit of account, an efficient medium of exchange, and a stable store of value. How well the monetary: system operates depends on the nation's central bank. Specifically, it depends on what objectives the Federal Reserve seeks to achieve and its success In achieving them. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1946, and subsequent amendments to those Acts --have given the Federal Reserve responsibility for multiple objectives, including stability in the purchasing power of the dollar, stability and growth of the economy, and high levels of employment. In my view, the basic objective of monetary policy should be to stabilize the price level. Vartables such as employment, output, and incomes, for example, cannot be controlled directly. The supply of goods and services available to consumers depends on the quantity of productive resources and how they are used. Monetary policy can do little to directly affect the total quantity of land, labor, and physical capital that is available, or the efficiency with which these resources are used. The Federal Reserve can, however, control the price level and, by providing a stable price environment, Can encourage investment and real economic growth. Through price stability, the Federal Reserve can provide an environment in which other economic objectives stand a better chance of being met. Neither the Federal Reserve, nor other policymakers, have adopted this view completely, but they have moved closer to it. Alan Greenspan, for example, in his most recent Humphrey-Hawkins Testimony stated, \\\"By price stability I mean a situation in which households and businesses in making thetr savings and investment decisions, can safely ignore the possibility of sustained generalized price increases or decreases. Essentially, the average of all prices would exhibit no trend over time. The strategy for monetary policy needs to be centered on making further progress toward and ultimately reaching stable prices. Price stability is a prerequisite for achieving the maximum economic expansion consistent with a sustainable external balance at full employment.\\\" Neither the statement nor the context in which it was made suggest that the Federal Reserve is not concerned about other objectives. Nevertheless, the statement is a clear delineation of what I believe is the appropriate framework for discussing monetary policy issues for 1989 and beyond. I would go even further. To promote general economic welfare, the Federal Reserve should stabilize the price level, even if it means putting other objectives aside. The Role of Money and Price Stability The role of money, and therefore, the role of monetary policy, is to provide transaction and information services. If the Federal Reserve stabilizes the price level, then transaction and information costs in the economy will be reduced, and we will have an optimum climate for decision-making and resource allocation. If the Federal Reserve fails to achieve an inflation-free environment, it will obscure relative price signals, raise transaction costs and add to uncertainty. Increased uncertainty about future inflation and about monetary policy objectives diminishes efficiency of resource use and adds to the instability of the economy. If monetary policy cannot control real economic variables directly, why do people believe it can influence the variables indirectly through stabilizing the price level? According to economic theory, people attain the highest possible level of welfare in a competitive economy with no transaction costs and perfect information. In this world, prices act as important signals, indicating the quantity of particular goods and services to be produced. Transaction Costs. In the real world, money and monetary policy do have a role to play because there are transaction costs and people do not have perfect information. Let us first consider the inefficiencies that arise from transaction costs. Labor contracts give employers considerable discretion over employment at a fixed-dollar wage rate. Transaction costs are evident by the fact that the contracted wage rate is not fully and continuously adjusted for inflation. However, people take expected inflation into account when entering into these contracts. Once wages are fixed, firms then choose output and employment levels to maximize profits. If inflation is higher than originally expected when the contracts were signed, the real wage rate will fall. Firms will increase output and employment to take advantage of higher profit margins. The resulting expansion of activity is unsustainable and therefore. Inappropriate because it arises from decisions that have been distorted by inflation, rather than representing an appropriate response to economic fundamentals. Once this misallocation of resources is realized, a costly readjustment of resources must be undertaken. Eventually, labor supplies, wages and employment will adjust to the underlying fundamental conditions. Monetary policy should be designed to prevent unexpected changes in the price level, and thereby keep the problems assoctated with fixed wage and price contracts to a minimum. In short, inflation reduces economic performance, holding output, employment, and incomes below their longer-term sustainable levels. Information Costs. Another important role for money and monetary policy is to provide information. For example, people face uncertainty when choosing whether to save or consume, because they do not know the real interest rate. The real interest rate, which represents the return to savings in terms of future consumption, is simply the nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of inflation. If people could predict inflation accurately, the problem would disappear. But because people are uncertain about future inflation and the real interest rate, they are unable to plan optimally for current and future consumption. The monetary authorities can reduce the problem by making the price level predictable. _7- Businesses also face this sort of uncertainty. Investment decisions depend on the cost of capital and on the expected return. Expected returns depend importantly on how accurately current interest rates reflect future inflation. Not having this information is costly. We know it 1s because we see firms paying for insurance by participating in financial futures and options markets. Many of the developments in the financial markets in the last 20 years represent attempts by the private economy to protect itself from uncertainty about inflation. Even if the price level cannot be predicted with certainty, the costs associated with inflation uncertainty can be reduced if the Federal Reserve focuses more sharply on a stable price level. These examples tllustrate why I conclude that the only Objective of monetary policy should be a stable price level. While the ultimate goal of the Federal Reserve jis to maintain stable domestic economic growth and full employment, I believe the only way to achieve these goals is to stabilize the price level. By price stability, mean a condition in which people expect and therefore act as though prices will be stable. People can adapt best to zero inflation. I don't mean that all the different components of price indexes will be unchanging. Each price index has its own peculfar characteristics. Non-monetary factors and measurement problems will always affect price indexes, but the short-term variation in the indexes should be just that--short-term variations around a zero trend. The Strategy: An Explicit Price Stability Goal This brings me to my main point, the need for a strategy for achieving price stability. Having chosen a stable price level as the appropriate objective for monetary policy, what is a sensible strategy for achieving it? Indeed we have made much progress in recent years. There are some lessons in that progress for us to consider. The first, and most important, element of a successful strategy is to enlist the support of market expectations, by announcing clear, explicit goals and acting in a credible manner to achieve them. When inflation was at double-digit rates at the end of the 1970s. people did not belfeve that inflation would stop rising, because the often-promised end to inflation was not delivered. In that environment, stating general policy goals simply was not credible. The Federal Reserve gained credibility in the 1980s by reducing inflation and preventing it from rising above a 3 to 5 percent zone. I think we can improve the performance of our economy by announcing a goal of zero inflation to be achieved over some reasonably short time period --3 to 5 years. If, as I believe, 5 percent is the rate of inflation today, then I suggest the acceptable upper limit should be 4 percent a year from now. If zero inflation is the goal, such a path, if steadfastly pursued, would produce a stable price level by 1993. I think an explicit goal with a clear timetable is the first part of an effective strategy. The second part of an effective strategy is demonstrating a determination to achteve it. While it may seem that there is never a good time to begin, price stability must be the focal point of our policy discussion. If price Stability 1s the overriding goal, other objectives must not interfere with efforts to achieve it. I believe that prompt and full explanations of policy and of policy changes, perhaps immediately following the actual decision, would help reduce uncertainty and allow markets to operate more efficiently. Market expectations would be better based and presumably more accurate with explicit statements of policy intentions and changes theretn. More efficient market expectations would, in turn, serve to discipline policy decisions. Achieving Price Stability The lack of a reliable short-term linkage between the monetary aggregates and the price level adds to the difficulty of knowing what.is the appropriate monetary policy to achieve a zero inflation goal. Externally, markets must be able to judge whether the Federal Reserve's actions are consistent with the desired outcome. Because policy works with a long and variable lag, it becomes more diffi cult than ever to know whether the Federal Reserve is using a good recipe or a bad one. The framework we use for making decisions must allow for uncertainty and minimize the costs associated with mistakes. In achieving price stability, some risks are more acceptable than others, because some mistakes are either less costly or more easily reversed. Inflation, once embedded in expectations, contracts and resource allocation dectsions, ts very costly to deal with. This fact argues strongly for a decision framework which tilts short-run implementation decisions away from the risks of inflation acceleration. The M2 Target As a Long-run Inflation Indicator. In the last few years the intention to reduce inflation has been manifested in the gradual reduction in the upper limit of the M2 target growth ranges. The M2 aggregate is composed of those assets that are used primarily for transactions and less liquid savings and smal] time deposits. The usefulness of M2 stems from the relative stability over long periods of time of its relationship to total -10- spending. In principle, an aggregate with a stable turnover rate, such as M2, can be used as a convenient indicator that policy is consistent with desired long-run trends in the price level. The upper limit on M2 growth can be thought of as an upper limit on total spending growth. Continued growth in M2, in excess of our long-term 3 percent or so growth in productivity, wil] resultin inflation. Continued reduction in M2 growth will eventually mean reduced inflation. In the last four years, the Federal Reserve has gradually reduced the upper limit of the M2 growth range from 9 percent to the 7 percent proposed last July for next year --a rate which by our calculations, if maintained for a long period of time, would be consistent with the present 3 percent inflation. The FOMC will review the target range for 1989 at its December meeting. The Need For A Short-Term Policy Guide. Unfortunately, M2 is not a useful short-term guide to policy actions because the connection between M2 and inflation is quite loose. Despite the reduction in the M2 target range and in M2 growth, inflation is slightly higher than four years ago. Inflation expectations, as measured by the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, have begun to increase again. Other surveys and economists forecasts, as wel] as the inflation forecasts embedded in asset prices, have begun to show a similar rebound of expectations. Money is special because it is used in transactions, reducing marketing and information costs, and because as the unit of account it is the basis for contractual obligations. Only about one-third of M2 is composed of those assets that provide a medium of exchange such as currency and deposits in checkable accounts. The balance of M2 consists of household savings which are F. extremely sensitive to interest-rate spreads. When market interest rates fall, banks may be slow to reduce interest rates on deposits and M2 tends to grow very rapidly, as in 1985 and 1986. When market rates rise, banks may be Slow to raise deposit rates and M2 tends to grow slowly, as it did in 1987 and as it has in 1988. The sensitivity of M2 to changes in interest rate spreads greatly diminishes its usefulness as a short-term guide to policy. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve does not have direct control over M2 as it does over the monetary base. The base contains currency and member-bank reserves which are Federal Reserve balance sheet liabilities. In principle, the base and the federal funds rate could be used as continuous monitoring devices to indicate whether daily, weekly and monthly policy actions are consistent with announced long-term goals. But the relationship between the monetary base and the various measures of the money supply, on the one hand, and the reported price indexes, on the other, is not close over short periods of time. In general, both the economy and the financial markets are buffeted by all sorts of disturbances. The problem is knowing which of these should be accommodated, and which should be resisted to keep inflation in check. Because the source of the disturbances is seldom clear, at least at the time, the Federal Reserve under the current operating procedures usually fully accommodates shocks, at least initially. The FOMC could target paths for the base from one meeting to the next and react to deviations from the target with automatic, but limited, changes in reserve restraint. Interest rates would respond partially, but automatically to resist incipient inflationary pressures. -]2- Using the base as a short-run operating vehicle would still require just as much judgment at FOMC meetings as at present. Given time to evaluate shocks to the economy, the FOMC would adjust the base target. Because the base s controllable, it would provide the Federal Reserve with a better way to explain how it was exercising judgment and how the short-term operating decisions fit within the strategy of moving toward price stability. Using the Forecast of the Price Level_as the Intermediate Target. While I see merit to using the monetary base as the operating target, let me make it clear that the objective is to stabilize the price level and thereby eliminate expectations of long-run inflation. On an annual basis I would prefer to target a controllable instrument, such as the monetary base. But there have been important shifts in money demand over the past decade, and I see no reason to ignore the possibility of future shifts. Consequently, it seems probable that a preset target for any aggregate would have to be adjusted to achieve and maintain a stable price level. Since our goal ts to control the price level, it seems reasonable to use the forecast of the price level as the intermediate target or as the frame of reference for adjusting the operating targets. The forecast of the price level over a one-to-three year horizon would be more sensitive to policy actions than would the price level itself. When we observe rising price expectations, and raise our own conditional forecast of the price level --that is, the forecast conditioned on the current policy stance --policy would be changed to bring our forecasts in line with the desired outcome. -13- Conclusion believe the Federal Reserve has the responsibility for providing an environment of stable prices. The Federal Reserve can achieve stable prices by formally announcing a goal of zero inflation to be attained over a reasonable period and a specific plan to achteve it. Undoubtedly, there will be short-term costs because many people will have written.contracts, developed investment plans, and established institutions in anticipation of continued inflation. But I believe that the adjustment costs can be minimized by reducing inflation gradually. Disinflation, typically, is associated with temporarily higher real interest rates. If we try to reduce inflation too fast, current financial problems in the Southwest and in the developing countries may be aggravated unnecessarily. On the other hand, credibility problems may result from going too slow. If people cannot perceive a reduction in inflation, or if they perceive a central bank that is either unwilling to commit to the objective or unwilling to begin the journey, they are unlikely to believe we will eliminate inflation. I propose that we reduce inflation by 1 percent per year from its current rate. A year ago, I proposed that we go from 4 percent inflation to zero in about 4 years. Today, the inflation rate has risen to 5 percent and a reasonable policy will now take a year longer and may entail higher costs.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"news\",\n          \"speech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date_y\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"1986-01-01 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2025-01-01 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 153,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2015-10-01 00:00:00\",\n          \"2016-04-01 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"GDP Growth Rate (%)\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 643090.1468450613,\n        \"min\": 4507.894,\n        \"max\": 4522116.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 319,\n        \"samples\": [\n          470949.9,\n          9411.682\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"GDP_Increase\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Chart 1, based on World Bank data illustrates the trend in world inflation, clearly showing the peak that occurred at a rate in excess of 35 percent per annum in the early 1990s and the rapid deceleration to rates around 5 per cent per annum thereafter. South Africas inflation performance began to improve during the 1990s, as the next chart indicates; and subsequent to the adoption of the inflation targeting framework, inflation as measured by CPIX entered and has remained within the target range since September 2003. Oil prices have risen sharply since 2003 (as the next chart indicates), on account of various determinants. During this year, the spot price of Brent crude oil has increased dramatically from approximately US59.9 per barrel in February to levels around US70.5 per barrel towards the end of April and an average of US68.15 per barrel in June. Continued brisk expansion in final consumption expenditure by households has been underpinned by a steady increase in household disposable income, continued buoyancy in the real estate and securities markets and what some describe as an accommodative interest rate environment. Overall household debt as a percentage of annualised disposable income increased to a record level of 68 percent in the first quarter of 2006. Robust growth in gross domestic expenditure and a concomitant strong increase in the value of merchandise imports resulted in a sizeable deficit on the trade account of the balance of payments in the first quarter of 2006. Given the larger shortfall on the services and income account with the rest of the world and the somewhat subdued performance of South Africas exports  notwithstanding the buoyancy of international commodity prices, the current account of the balance of payments registered a deficit equivalent to 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2006. Interestingly, as others have observed, despite the sell-off in emerging markets since May, nonresidents have remained net buyers of South African financial assets and there have been significant investment flows into South Africa over the past year. Non-resident investors bought a net R13 billion worth of South African equities during May 2006 and R460 million the first half of June 2006. Despite generally negative sentiment towards emerging market-market assets, they continued to buy R768 million worth of bonds in May and R4.5 billion in June. About this there can be little argument, for all that I have done is to summarise the facts. It is also not in dispute that the repo rate, the rate at which the South African Reserve Bank will lend to the banks, was increased recently, primarily on account of deteriorating risks to the outlook for inflation. What we can debate, and what I look forward to hearing your views about, is the nature of the conflict regarding the outlook for interest rates in South Africa. The South African Reserve Bank Monetary Policy Review (May 2006) states it as follows: On the one hand the inflation outlook, as reflected in the recent inflation forecasts of the Bank, has improved significantly on the other hand, there a number of developments that have led the MPC to remain vigilant. This was before the last meeting of the MPC. Does a dilemma remain and how would you characterise it? Let me have your views. 66/2006 1\",\n          \"Donald L Kohn: Monetary policy and imbalances Speech by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Banking and Finance Lecture Series, Widener University, Chester, 1 April 2004. * * * Interest rates in the United States have been very low for some time. The Federal Reserve targets the overnight federal funds rate, and for almost a year this rate has stood at 1 percent. By comparison, the funds rate averaged more than 5 percent during the 1990s, and was last at 1 percent in the 1950s. Similarly, the yield on a ten-year Treasury note now stands near 4 percent - a level not seen since 1963 and more than 3 percentage points below the average of the past twenty years. These low rates are no accident. The economy began to weaken in late 2000, and aggregate activity began to contract in early 2001. Starting in January of 2001, the Federal Reserve moved to counter this weakness by lowering the funds rate to its present level in a series of steps that ended last June. This prompt and aggressive action undoubtedly served to limit the decline in economic activity, and, in fact, the recent recession was one of the mildest on record. The Federal Reserve recognizes that the federal funds rate is currently lower than it can be on a sustainable basis: At some point, as the economy moves back toward higher levels of employment, policy accommodation will no longer be needed and the funds rate will be raised. But it does not appear that we are as yet at that point. The Federal Reserve has opted to keep its policy rate quite low and has said it can be patient in removing the degree of accommodation. Although the economy has indeed strengthened over the past few quarters, job growth has been anemic and considerable slack persists in labor markets. At the same time, inflation has been quite low and shows few signs that it is in the process of picking up. Recently, some observers have been calling for the Federal Reserve to begin the tightening process sooner rather than later. In a few cases, the reasoning appears to be that we are risking a major increase in inflation by waiting. But most of the calls for a prompt policy tightening are instead based on the concern that the Federal Reserve, by keeping the funds rate so low and signaling that it is likely to stay low for a while, is sowing the seeds for different kinds of future problems. In particular, these critics worry that a continued environment of low interest rates is giving rise to economic imbalances excessive indebtedness, and elevated prices of houses, equities, and bonds - that in the longer run will come back to haunt us. They fear that the return to more-normal levels of short-term interest rates might eventually be accompanied by an especially sharp upswing in bond and mortgage rates, a softening in the prices of houses and equities, and problems for households in meeting higher debt obligations that, in turn, could result in a substantial weakening in spending. Those worried about these possibilities say that the Federal Reserve should begin to remove its policy accommodation promptly to limit any further buildup of debt and distortions of asset prices. Most of these analysts acknowledge that such an action will entail some short-run pain - a slower recovery and a weaker rebound in labor markets. But they see this near-term loss as more then compensated for by the long-run gain of avoiding severe problems in the more distant future. Today I would like to examine this line of reasoning. The issue may seem abstract and arcane to an audience of non-economists - inside baseball as played in the financial markets and in the Board Room of the Federal Reserve. But the approach taken to this policy question could have serious consequences for the U.S. economy, and it illustrates nicely the types of subtle but fascinating issues policymakers must confront. I must emphasize that these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve. The effects of low interest rates As I have already discussed, the current level of the federal funds rate came about in response to a weakening economy in 2001 and a recovery that has been characterized by the persistence of considerable slack in labor markets and low and declining inflation. 20/2004 1 Stimulative monetary policy helps the economy recover from a spell of economic weakness largely through its effects on interest rates and asset prices. Long-term interest rates - the ones most relevant to the borrowing and spending decisions of households and firms - have been held down by easy monetary policy and the expectation that short-term rates will remain low for some time. And these low rates in turn have boosted the prices of houses and the value of corporate equity. Under the influence of increased wealth and low borrowing costs, households have bought more and larger houses and cars, have taken on more debt, and generally have spent more than would have been the case if interest rates had been higher. On the business side, low rates have helped firms reduce debt servicing and rebuild financial resilience by issuing long-term debt and paying off short-term debt, setting the stage for a step-up in investment. Stronger balance sheets and higher profits have induced investors to reduce the risk premiums they require to lend to businesses, which has further supported business spending. Nothing is necessarily wrong with these developments; in fact, they are by-and-large the intended and logical consequences of the Federal Reserves efforts to reduce economic slack through low interest rates. To be sure, when short-term interest rates rise, bond yields will also rise, the amount of income needed to service debt will increase, and the prices of houses and equity will begin to reflect the greater competition for savers dollars. But as long as interest rates and asset prices are reasonably well aligned with the forces likely to affect the economy, and as long as the public has reasonably accurate expectations about the size and timing of the eventual increase in interest rates and its effect on wealth and debt service, then the economy should not experience any particularly severe bumps when these developments unfold. Under these circumstances, households and firms, in the aggregate, should not end up looking back on their borrowing and spending actions as a mistake. If they do not view them as a mistake, they are unlikely to make major revisions in spending plans or asset valuations, and the effects on financial markets and the economy should be limited. Of course, expectations cannot be entirely accurate; the path interest rates will follow depends on future economic developments, many of which inevitably will be surprises, and in response markets will need to adjust, perhaps substantially. Moreover, some households and firms probably harbor unrealistic expectations about the future based on extrapolations of recent interest rates or trends in asset prices, and they run the risk of experiencing serious difficulties as a result. But as long as myopia appeared to be restricted to a relatively small portion of the population, and asset prices and expectations in the aggregate seemed realistic given what we know today, we would have little reason to anticipate serious problems as interest rates adjust. However, if imbalances were thought to exist if expectations appeared unrealistic and asset prices distorted - then we would judge that the potential for a sharp correction in financial markets and associated economic instability was greater. Is there evidence that imbalances are emerging? Determining whether such imbalances are present is a difficult task, and assessing whether those imbalances are related to current policy is even more challenging. But given their potential consequences for the economy, these are issues that policymakers cannot ignore. Let me begin with the question of whether interest rates and asset prices have been pushed away from appropriate levels. Some observers worry that recent Federal Reserve policy, by keeping short-term rates at very low levels for an extended period, has encouraged investors to reach for yield - that is, to shift their portfolios toward riskier and longer-term securities, which generally have higher yields, to keep realized returns from falling. They also worry about the effects of a related behavior in which financial intermediaries borrow at low short-term rates to lend at higher long-term rates - the so-called carry trade - and about the effects of low interest rates on the prices of houses. To a considerable extent, these processes are part of the efficient functioning of markets: Investors should compare the return they would receive on holding short-term deposits or the cost of borrowing short-term to the potential returns on riskier assets and make investment decisions on the basis of the trade-off between return and risk. Indeed, behaviors of this sort transmit accommodative monetary policy through financial markets to accomplish its intended effect of stimulating demand. The issue is whether this process has gone too far - that is, whether investors are failing to take adequate account of the risks of those alternative investments. Forming such a judgment requires a view on the level of asset prices that would be appropriate given economic fundamentals. Unfortunately, economists are not very good at this, but neither is anyone else, including Wall Street analysts. 2 20/2004 The Treasury securities market has been one focus of some concern. Some observers argue that, in part because of the carry trade and similar sorts of strategies, rates on intermediate- and longer-term Treasury securities are too low. An important observation, however, is that the yield curve is currently quite steep, implying that market participants have priced in a substantial rise in short-term rates. Indeed, the current shape of the yield curve suggests that investors expect short-term rates will eventually be in the neighborhood of 4 to 5 percent. This expected rate is not unusually low by historical standards; it is near or even above the expectations during the low-inflation period of the 1950s and early 1960s, and it is well within the range of expectations since the mid-1990s. The yield curve implies a fairly gradual transition to those long-run levels, and some could argue that this implied adjustment is too gradual. However, this pattern in part reflects the Federal Reserves statements about policy patience and the fact that the economic expansion so far has made only limited progress in reducing slack, particularly in the labor market, even at very low interest rates. Overall, the question of whether the yield curve is steep enough is difficult to answer. Some analysis suggests that Treasury yields should be a bit higher, and we cannot rule out the possibility that long-term rates will rise once labor markets begin to strengthen convincingly. Nonetheless, it would be hard to argue with much confidence that yields are substantially out of line with plausible configurations of fundamental influences. Corporate bonds have also been the subject of some concern - specifically, whether the risk spreads on bonds issued by domestic corporations, which have narrowed dramatically, particularly for lower-rated issuers, are too low to offer adequate compensation for the probability of future defaults. It would be surprising had we not seen a narrowing of credit spreads over this period. Corporate profits have expanded quite briskly of late, and various measures of business financial difficulties have declined substantially. Moreover, the outlook for corporations appears favorable, considering that we are now in the early stages of what we hope will be an extended period of economic expansion. Many spreads remain above levels they reached through much of the 1990s, and while they may be thin, they do not appear to be clearly unreasonable in the context of recent and expected developments. Warnings about a possible bubble in house prices have been sounded for a number of years now. About a year ago, I examined this issue in some detail and concluded that, while one could never be very confident about such a judgment, house prices were not obviously too high and the housing stock was not clearly too large.1 Since then, however, prices have climbed further, and by more than the rise in rents - a proxy for the return on houses. Consequently, the odds have risen that these prices could be out of line with fundamentals. We still cannot be very confident about whether a significant misalignment exists, however. Moreover, some factors, including increasing prosperity and wealth associated in part with rapid gains in labor productivity and earning power, should help support house prices in the future and thereby reduce the risk of a sizable correction in which prices actually fall across a large number of localities. Finally, concerns have been expressed about the level of debt in our economy, especially household debt. Debt owed by households is high relative to their income, and so too are the payments required by that debt and by other regular obligations. But the vast majority of households are not encountering problems meeting obligations, and they have protected themselves to a considerable extent against increasing interest rates by borrowing for longer terms at fixed rates. As a consequence, debt servicing obligations will rise very gradually even if market interest rates increase rapidly. Moreover, any increase in rates would most probably occur in circumstances in which income and employment were also rising briskly, and thus adding to the resources available to consumers. And, while debt has been increasing, assets on household balance sheets have been rising even more rapidly. Barring a collapse in house or equity prices when interest rates rise, household net worth should remain comfortably above the levels of a few years ago. This has been a very fast and somewhat cursory tour through U.S. financial markets. But the main point should be clear: Although one can never be certain, in my view, the odds are that any imbalances that have emerged in U.S. asset markets or in the level of borrowing by U.S. households and businesses are not so substantial that they will disrupt the economy when they begin to correct. To be sure, the prices of assets and the level of debt seem to reflect expectations of a benign economic environment - one in which policy will tighten only gradually, the economy will continue to 1 Donald Kohn, The Strength in Consumer Durables and Housing: Policy Stabilization or Problem in the Making? Paper given at the conference on Finance and Macroeconomics, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, February 28, 2003. 20/2004 3 strengthen and inflation will remain low, and the demand for houses and equities will remain solid. Although these expectations could leave markets exposed to unfavorable news, they are not obviously unreasonable. In the absence of any substantial distortions in asset prices and debt levels, households and businesses, on average, have not likely been engaging in misguided decisions that they, or the central bank, will come to regret. Nevertheless, as emphasized above, policymakers face a tremendous amount of uncertainty regarding this judgment. Some borrowers and lenders will be caught by surprise when rates rise and will suffer losses; houses could be overvalued in some markets and subject to correction; and even small, largely predictable changes in interest rates and asset prices could interact in unexpected ways. And asset prices and interest rates that look roughly in line with fundamentals today, may not be tomorrow. Because they cannot rule out the chance that some asset prices might correct more than anticipated, policymakers must consider how the economy might withstand such a correction. Corrections in interest rates and asset values may have the most potential for disruption when they impair the financial health of borrowers and lenders and thereby cause them to pull back even further than might be warranted by the change in rates or prices. In that regard, we have some reason to be optimistic that the players are well positioned to absorb these adjustments. We have already discussed the reasons for confidence that household borrowers will be able to meet their obligations. Lenders, too, appear well positioned to weather any such adjustments. Commercial banks remain highly profitable and well capitalized, and other financial intermediaries show few signs of widespread problems. I am encouraged by the way our financial system came through the very difficult circumstances of the last few years, including the plunge in equity values, the recession, the subsequent period of slow growth, and the spike in credit problems. To be sure, pockets of difficulty emerged, and lenders became more cautious, but, for the most part, credit continued to flow, and problems remained isolated, not systemic. Our increasingly sophisticated financial market was able to effectively distribute risk so that lenders were sufficiently diversified to survive some quite stressful developments. In addition, financial markets have important automatic-stabilizer properties. If investors sense that asset-price adjustments are undermining the expansion, interest rates will fall back because investors will anticipate a lower trajectory for the federal funds rate. For its part, the Federal Reserve will adapt its monetary policy to unexpected developments in an effort to keep the economy on track toward high employment and stable prices. Implications for the current policy setting That brings me to what I see as the implications of this analysis for the Federal Reserves current monetary policy of keeping the federal funds rate low and being patient in removing policy accommodation. I hope that the discussion has cast some doubt on the argument that this policy is generating substantial imbalances in the economy. I am not disputing the argument that current policy has contributed to higher asset prices, more household indebtedness, and strong activity in interest-sensitive sectors such as housing. But I am questioning the apparently firm conclusion of some that these developments represent distortions or imbalances that are likely to correct in an abrupt and harmful manner. At the very minimum, one cannot reach this conclusion with a great deal of confidence. The distortions in the markets I have reviewed do not appear all that large, given the stance of monetary policy, and should we experience much higher interest rates and softer asset prices our resilient markets and flexible economy probably could absorb such a shock. Nonetheless, I cannot rule out the possibility that destabilizing imbalances are building. Should policymakers adjust policy today to slow the growth of debt and limit potential overshooting in bond and housing markets? Such a policy would clearly have near-term costs: It would slow the expansion in demand, damp the creation of new jobs, and keep inflation lower than it otherwise would be. Those costs could be significant, given that the economy is already operating with substantial slack and that any further decline in inflation would leave it at uncomfortably low levels. In my view, policymakers face a very high burden of proof when it comes to accepting fairly predictable short-term pain in the form of slower expansion in exchange for the possibility of gain over the longer run in the form of reduced risks of fluctuations in output, induced by sharp and unanticipated variations in interest rates and asset prices. Despite some signs that values are stretched in some markets, I do not believe this burden of proof has been met at this time. 4 20/2004 Can actions be taken to limit the longer-run risks without near-term policy adjustments? At least two considerations come to mind. For one, policymakers should continue to remind people that the federal funds rate very probably will have to move up at some point, and that they should be prepared for that adjustment. Households with high debt loads need to take account of the fact that the interest payments on their floating-rate loans will increase, probably taking a higher portion of their spendable funds. Those lending to such households also need to take into account the rise in rates when they judge credit worthiness. Households and those that lend to them also cannot count on large increases in house prices persisting. Rising rates are sure to cool the housing market, and possibly could cause prices to soften in some localities. Investors, too, must be aware that short-term interest rates, and hence the opportunity cost of their longer-term investments, will increase. Borrowing short and lending long is risky and not a sure-fire way to eternally high profits. Investors are unlikely to be able to exit from these bets before the market starts to adjust; it is highly probable that many folks in similar circumstances will be trying to squeeze through the same door at the same time, in which case prices could adjust sharply. The second consideration is that regulators of financial institutions should strive to ensure that these institutions have risk-management systems in place that help to assess and control vulnerability to potential adjustments in interest rates and asset prices. In doing so, supervisors reinforce market discipline. Banking supervisors at the Federal Reserve, for example, in the course of the ongoing examination process, have been paying close attention to the sorts of vulnerabilities we have reviewed and have been discussing these risks with the commercial banks they oversee. Conclusion Interest rates are at unsustainable levels, and monetary policy will need to tighten eventually if the economy is to be kept on a path to high employment and price stability. My remarks today were not focused on the medium-term macroeconomic outlook and its implications for policy. Instead, I addressed a different and difficult set of issues for policymakers - whether policy adjustment should be made that might make the medium-term outlook less favorable but might at the same time lower the odds on longer-term economic instability stemming from possible imbalances in financial markets. This issue has been the subject of considerable research and discussion in recent years, and I have not had time to touch on all its aspects. In recent months some central banks have cited similar types of financial imbalances when they tightened policy. But the economies in which these central banks operate have been running at higher levels of resource utilization and have experienced faster increases in some asset prices than has the United States. My conclusion is that for the United States at this time, the balance of costs and benefits does not favor policy action to address possible imbalances. In the process, I hope that I have given you a sense of the difficult judgments facing a policymaker in an uncertain world and that you have also gotten a taste of the intellectual interest and excitement of working through such issues. This exercise is very similar to many others you would find in the public sector, and so I also hope you keep these challenges and rewards in mind when considering your career path. 20/2004 5\",\n          \"VAL OUTLOOK FOR THE BANKING INDUSTRY IN THE 1990s Remarks by Robert P. Forrestal, President Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta For the Institute of Management Accountants, Atlanta Chapter in Atlanta, Georgia November 19, 1991 I am pleased to have been invited to address this group, whose membership, I understand, is the third largest in the country. As a bank regulator, I am certainly aware of how much we depend on accountants to ensure that corporate financial conditions are reported accurately--and meaningfully. In fact, one of the topics of debate in the banking industry now is whether to continue to use traditional generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or to switch to market-value accounting. I will touch briefly on this issue later in my remarks. My overall topic this evening is the outlook for the banking industry in the 1990s. As many of you may have surmised, these should continue to be difficult times for banks--and for their customers. However, I do see cause for optimism in the consolidation that is taking place. This trend is helping some banks to strengthen their balance sheets and to increase their capital levels. In discussing the condition of the banking industry, I would first like to outline how it got to where it is today and then discuss how the industry might respond in the short term to the economic environment and banking reform legislation. Finally, I would like to look at the long term and envision the future of the banking industry after the year 2000. Banking in November 1991: Where We are Today Part of what has brought the banking industry to this time of consolidation and loan write-offs has been overcapacity and, more recently, an excessive concentration of real estate loans in Digitized for FRASER nttp://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Digitized for FRASER Federal Reserve Bank their portfolios. Let me first address why we have too much capacity in the banking industry. As I see it, the main reason has been deposit insurance. Although deposit insurance has helped to shield the industry from systemic bank runs and has provided security for small depositors, it has also served as an implicit subsidy. This has made it attractive to open a bank in an already crowded banking system. As a result, the United States now has too many banking institutions vying for too few sound loan prospects, reducing profitability to very low levels. Eventually, this situation could pose a risk to taxpayers as well. To some extent, the marketplace has begun to solve the problem of overcapacity through consolidation. Indeed, as I alluded to earlier, some of the larger banks in the nation have begun to merge to strengthen their balance sheets. During the 1990s, more community and regional banks may find themselves in similar situations. However, the public sector must play a role in the solution to overcapacity, because it has inadvertently contributed to the problem--both through regulation that created protected markets and by deposit insurance. While I believe it is socially desirable to keep deposit insurance, it is equally important, in my opinion, to reduce the deposit insurance subsidy. Unfortunately, lawmakers seem unable to come to grips with this underlying defect in the banking industry, although the narrow bill under consideration in the House of Representatives would, to some extent, reduce the safety net for the industry. Another problem area for banks has been making provisions for and writing off problem loans. Although banks have long been able to make profitable loans to the real estate industry, that same industry is now in turmoil. After having overbuilt in most parts of the nation, some .org/ of St. Louis Digitized for FRASER Federal Reserve Bank developers cannot repay their loans in a timely manner or according to the terms of the original loan agreement. You need only observe the near-vacant office buildings in Atlanta and its suburbs to recognize that banks which financed these projects are being adversely affected. Nonetheless, this region looks much better compared to New England, which has extensive real estate problems. And the potential downside is not nearly as great as it is in California. It is true that we are still seeing the effects of over-investment in real estate assets, since many of these loans are just now going bad, even though the economic recovery, in my opinion, is under way. This situation means that some banks may eventually have to write off more bad loans. Nonetheless, the worst is probably behind us, even in real estate. Current Banking Reform Legislation In addition to overcapacity and loan reserve write-offs, the proposed banking reform legislation has been another concern for banks. Even those institutions that advocate major changes find it hard to do strategic planning in an environment of legislative uncertainty. Before the banking proposal from the Treasury Department met resistance in Congress, I had had higher hopes that some serious and fundamental financial industry reform would result. Although I did not think the legislative reform proposals were perfect, I am currently less sanguine about the prospects for legislation that would systematically address the problems the banking industry faces. Right now, Congress is recognizing only part of the problem--the need to curb risk-taking by banks. The narrow bill that could be passed focuses mainly on recapitalizing the Bank Insurance Fund, tightening regulations, and eliminating the \\\"too big to fail\\\" doctrine by limiting the scope of deposit insurance and by requiring prompt resolution when problems arise at banks. .org/ of St. Louis There is also, though, still some chance that legislators will include a measure to allow banks to expand by way of nationwide branching. What lawmakers are not recognizing is the need to allow banks to compete with nonbanks. Those of us who would like to see banks become more competitive with other businesses that offer bank-like services had hoped that the legislation would grant new powers to banks. Specifically, we would like banks to have the chance to sell insurance, securities, and mutual funds, similar to the way businesses in those three industries have been able to offer bank services, such as checkable deposits. If we end up with only a narrow bill that does not include these new powers, as I now fear, I believe Congress will have made a mistake. Certainly, legislators will have to revisit the same issues that are not resolved in this session. The trouble is that new legislation would probably not be taken up until after the presidential election, which means at least a two-year wait for badly needed reform. Banking in November 1992: Short-term changes If Congress and the Administration are not able to agree on fundamental banking reform--and, of course, I am in no position to forecast what Congress will do--the banking industry will not change a great deal over the next two or three years. Without the bank reform legislation, banks can only continue to slowly push their way into areas like securities. In fact, regulators have already allowed some of the best-capitalized banks to move into securities underwriting on a limited basis. Digitized for FRASER .org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Not all will remain the same, however. If Congress does incorporate the nationwide branching measure into the bill it finally passes, we will see many more banks crossing state lines to set up branches. Even if Congress does not include this measure in the bill it passes, big banks will continue to expand into new territory. The difference is that, without legislation, the changes will happen more slowly and perhaps less rationally. One way or the other, these moves toward nationwide interstate banking will promote more competition, something that is always good for customers. But there is also a good side for bankers to be considered. As it stands now, the patchwork of regional agreements among states has added to the expense of establishing new offices. The bank holding company structure requires redundant layers of management as well as boards of directors. If banking institutions could simply convert their subsidiaries into branches, they could move to consolidate their corporate and operational structures. This approach would be a relatively quick way to reduce some costs and thereby enhance banking profitability. Of course, the other salient feature in the banking landscape will be the continuing consolidation. We have just come through a period of intense merger activity with such high- profile banks as Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical, C&S, and NCNB. Now comes the time when these merged institutions must transform their \\\"on-paper\\\" cost savings to real cost savings. This will take a certain ruthlessness. If banks cannot meet their targets for lower costs and higher profits, then there may be a slowdown in the number of mergers. Merger activity also depends on the strength of the industry. As long as times are bad, banks are not likely to volunteer themselves for mergers. In this kind of atmosphere, while we will continue to see Digitized for FRASER .org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Digitized for FRASER Federal Reserve Bank problem banks being forced to merge, strong banks will be able to wait for better deals. Overall, though, as bank stock prices and equity values go up, there should be another wave of mergers down the road. Banking in the year 2000--Envisioning the Future If this consolidation trend continues, we might ask where this will leave us in the year 2000. I do not believe for a moment that the industry will pare itself to the five or six major banks that typify other countries, such as Great Britain and Canada. That is because the United States is starting from a point of 12,000 banks, thanks in large part to the historical absence of nationwide branching. There will be fewer banks--in my view, by the year 2000, the industry might be at 8,000 to 9,000 banks. But as to how many banks we will ultimately have, that is harder to say, because the optimal size of the industry will be determined by market forces. As I envision the future for banks, I can see that the industry will still be diverse, and that it will remain structured as a tiered system. Today, we have three tiers: money-center banks, super regionals, and community banks. Two schools of thought prevail as to what the future structure will be. Either these three tiers would remain or they would rearrange eventually into two tiers. In the three-tiered structure, one tier would consist of a handful of national banking organizations big enough to serve the needs of the largest banking customers, including those operating abroad. Most of these banks would also operate national or large regional branch systems. A second tier would consist of a large group of community and niche banks. These will continue to be necessary, because community banks are the main source of credit for small .org/ of St. Louis business, which many believe plays a bigger role in the United States than in other advanced economies. Between these two groups of banks would lie the third tier of large banks, most with multiregional franchises. Alternatively, as the second school of thought would have it, the industry will end up with only two tiers, because banks in the middle tier would be subjected to considerable pressure either to grow large or to be acquired. Concurrently, banks will be competing with a growing number of nonbank providers. I would hope that by the year 2000, banks will have earned the right to get into securities, mutual funds, and the insurance business. These new powers will be absolutely necessary to allow banks to compete in the marketplace. In addition, banks in the year 2000 and beyond will have to offer more services to attract companies that will be marketing globally. Corporate clients will continue to migrate to the most efficient banks and locations--whether they are U.S. banks or foreign banks. If regulations limit U.S. banks or their markets, then businesses will, in effect, look off-shore in order to find what they need in the way of financial services. However, if given a chance to compete on a roughly level playing field, then the record of innovation by U.S. banks suggests that they will continue to be major players in the international financial services market. In the United States, banks have not been merely creative, they have also been strengthened by adversity, which should be an advantage when it comes time to venture farther out into the global economy. Canadas Big 6 banks and the banks of most European countries Digitized for FRASER .org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 8 have virtual monopoly franchises. They have not really been tested by much competition. Could it be that these institutions are not quite at \\\"fighting weight\\\"? In a global economy, such banks are likely to go head-to-head against many other institutions, both smaller and larger, putting these banks to the kind of test U.S. banks have already been enduring. Therefore, while the U.S. banking system may appear to be weak now, it may also turn out that our experience with adversity has helped to toughen our banks. However, before U.S. banks can enter the global marketplace, they must first be able to weather the stormy 1990s. To get to the year 2000, they can particularly use your help. At the beginning of my remarks, I mentioned that bankers and regulators are debating whether to move from GAAP towards more market-value accounting. This form of accounting has been proposed to help solve the banking crisis and to help shore up the bank insurance fund. I believe the industry could use your assistance in evaluating the potential of market-value accounting. At this point, the American Bankers Association is on record against market-value accounting, because the association feels it would be too difficult and costly to implement. After all, bank loans are rather special products, unlike securities, and there is a sizable cost to valuing them. On the other side, many people concerned with the health of the Bank Insurance Fund would like to see market-value accounting used to promote prompter closures of weak banks, thus saving the fund from peril. A more valid debate could take place if bankers had a better understanding of the costs and benefits of moving to a system of market-value accounting. Conclusion Digitized for FRASER .org/ Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis In conclusion, these are difficult yet exciting times for the banking industry. Hard times in the real estate industry are causing short-term problems for the bottom lines of banks. Congress does not seem to be able to bring itself to pass legislation informed by a long-term perspective--reform that would modernize the regulatory framework of the financial services industry. Meanwhile, consolidation is trimming the number of banks. Yet, the future holds out a promise of new opportunities. Banks will be able to service clients that are marketing globally. Banks will also most likely be able to sell securities, mutual funds, and insurance. And, they will have learned many lessons about competing in a less-protected environment. Those banks that survive the difficulties of today will certainly be more ready to take on the world. They will have trimmed their weight through consolidation and trained their managers to think innovatively. I, for one, am looking forward to the next decade when I believe that U.S. banks will prove they can compete with the largest banks in the global arena.
